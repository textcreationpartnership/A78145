            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE preſent State and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, cauſe great Thoughts of Heart, every wiſe Man conſidering, not what will beſt gratifie his own Humour, Paſſion, perſonal Intereſt, or Opinion, but what may be beſt for the peace, wealth, ſtrength, ſafety, and ſettlement of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Every Fool can make breaches and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, but it requires good Wiſdom to heal them. <hi>A wiſe Mans Heart diſcerneth both Time, and Judgment, ſaith</hi> Solomon; &amp; <hi>Tempori parendum,</hi> was the Motto of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond: we may better ſee what we may be able to do; than what is beſt to be done in our preſent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. We have amongſt us a company of raſh, heady, fierce, ignorant, and felf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident People, who if wiſely managed by the prudence of Government, may be made uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:152189:3"/> in the Nation, to the enriching and ſtrengthning of it, who are no way fit to have the Reins in their own hand, whether they be Conformiſts or not. Was the fear of God, and the Principles of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion more ſet up in the Hearts of Men, it would greatly be to the advantage both of Church, and State: I have been thinking how this may be beſt done. And ſeeing though we have many ſorts of Opinions amongſt us, yet we all profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians, and unite in that Centre, I thought it might be a good work to ſhew men briefly, what Chriſtianity is, and what they are obliged to be, by being Chriſtians; and have run over as many particulars about it, as I could at preſent think of; and finding that many of our Diſorders and Miſtakes ariſe, from want of a due underſtanding of, and regular reſpect to <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> I have therefore given a brief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of both, to engage Men to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Honour, and Reſpect which are due to both: And that none may ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in being Proteſtants, if they are not alſo true Chriſtians. I find, 'tis not being of this, or that Party, or Opinion in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which makes a right Chriſtian. We
<pb facs="tcp:152189:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> may obſerve ſome bad Men in all, and I hope there may be ſome good, I would be loth to condemn all in a Lump. If I ſee a Man's Actions bad, I will ſay he is a bad Man, let his Profeſſion be this or that; and ſo would I hope on the contrary. We have infallible Rules in the Word of God, to judge of Men by: Though for the moſt part we judge of Men by falſe Rules, ſuited to a Party, Opinion, or ſome ſecular Intereſt. But as I hate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs and Debauchery, ſo I abhor Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, or Hypocriſie, in all Profeſſions, ſo as to make Religion a pretence to Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Covetouſneſs; to fraud and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenage; to Murders, and Maſſacres, to Treaſons and Rebellions. <hi>The Form of Religion without the Power of it, the fairer it appears the fouler it is,</hi> is a good ſaying of a late Writer. <hi>Religion is moſt wounded in the Houſe of its falſe Friends.</hi> And ſome upright, and innocent Souls, may ſuffer by the miſcarriages of ſome of their own Party; whereof we have had many Inſtances of late amongſt us. I am confident all good Chriſtians agree in more things, than they differ: And there may be forbearance where there is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially when the ſafety of Religion
<pb facs="tcp:152189:4"/> requires it: And ſometimes the Providence of God doth that for a People, which their own endeavours could not accompliſh. Let wiſe Men obſerve its preſent Indications and act accordingly.</p>
            <p>I find in the feavouriſh heats of Mens diſputes, the Vitals of Religion are apt to expire, and we have but too many ſad <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi> of it in the Nation, at this day: And to recover it to its primitive vigour, and activity, in the right Sphear, is the main Deſign of theſe papers; that there may be found more true Chriſtianity, amongſt thoſe who bear the Name of Chriſtians, and the Name of Proteſtants alſo. For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of many of them is ſuch, that we have as good ground of hope, for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Turks and Infidels as of theirs. It is not External Incorporating with any viſible Church, whether the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other, that puts a Man into a State of Salvation, without having a ſanctified Heart, and a Reformed Life. Many are ambitious to make <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to their Opinions, and their Church, and then call them Converts, when poſſibly thereby, they may be made <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times more the children of Hell than before.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152189:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> I am ſure the chief End of all Religion is the Salvation of Mens Souls, and they are not likely to attain it in any Religion, if they are not ſincere in it: And ſincerity lies more in the Heart, than the Head: And therefore ſeeing mens heads, have of late been much exerciſed about Diſputes, and the Polemical parts of Religion, and vindicating the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt the Errors of the Papiſts, (and of which there hath been great uſe,) I thought it might be ſeaſonable to ſubjoyn ſomething about practical Religion, which is ſo much wanting in the Nation. Our Saviour ſtyles his Apoſtles not only the <hi>Lights of the World,</hi> but the <hi>Salt of the Earth;</hi> And ſent them forth not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Mens Judgments, but to ſeaſon and ſanctifie their Hearts and Lives. The chief buſineſs of theſe Papers is to expoſe <hi>good Salt</hi> to publick Sale; and as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls upon Men to <hi>buy the Truth,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah, To buy wine and milk,</hi> So I hope this Salt will be bought up a pace, it being ſo neceſſary for every mans uſe. For as corruption in the Heart and Life doth oftentimes corrupt the Judgment, and makes Men receptive of any Religion, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:152189:5"/> Sanctity of Heart and Life may be a great means to preſerve men from Popery, and erroneous Doctrines, and eſtabliſh them in the true Religion. Therefore I hope theſe Papers will not be thought unſeaſonable. We know the Proteſtant, Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is the Profeſſion of theſe Nations, and therefore attempts to promote a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation are ſurely ſeaſonable in ſuch a jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, when the three Eſtates of the Land are ingaged in the eſtabliſhing of it. My deſign is to draw a ſtrait Theological Line, whereby Men may diſcern both Rectitude and Obliquity; what they are, or what they ought to be. And if any will account me a Fool for ſpeaking plainly, I am content to be ſo accounted, if I can make others wiſe.</p>
            <p>And let me advertiſe the Reader, that he will not find any rare things in the following Diſcourſe, I mean rare in the Notion, but many things, God knows, too rare in Mens practice.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL Religion in the World hath Reſpect to a <hi>Deity;</hi> and was there no God, there need to be no Religion, and they caſt off a Deity, and may be termed Atheiſts, who caſt off all Religion. But there are ſuch bright Characters of a Deity in the Works of Creation, and in every Mans Conſcience, as that there are but few who embrace not ſome Religion or other: And tho ſome Men ſeem to live as though there was no God, yet when they are in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, or in the approaches of Death, the ſenſe of a Deity returns upon them; as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt Nature will at ſome time or other recurr. And therefore ſuch as promote Impiety under pretexts of Religion, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do more miſchief, and have greater ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152189:6"/> then thoſe who ſeek to do it by diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt a Deity. I know ſome have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make themſelves and others Atheiſts; as <hi>Lucretius</hi> boaſts of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that he was the firſt that ſought to deliver the World from the burthenſome Yoke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: but he had not many Followers. Yet I fear the notion of a Deity may be much ſtifled in many; for when they ſee all things come to paſs by ſecond cauſes; when they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſee Vice and Wickedneſs rampant in the world, and true Piety, and Virtue under Contempt; and when they obſerve ſo many Sects in the World, and differences about Religion; and how the generality of Men, though they have no fear of God, yet they fare as well as thoſe that fear him; and when they ſee the Apoſtacy and Hypocriſie of many that have made great Profeſſion, and the ſimpleneſs and weakneſs of others; they begin to think, all that is diſcourſed about a Deity, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Judgment to come, Heaven and Hell, or any Religion, are but fanatick Fancies, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Conceits, or politick Inventions, either of Princes to keep the People under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or of Prieſts to make Markets of Peoples Conſciences. But my buſineſs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is not with theſe, but ſuch as own and acknowledge a Deity, profeſs Religion, yea, the beſt, and only true Religion, the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtian Religion; a Religion founded firſt in Gods Eternal Councels, for the higheſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152189:6"/> Manifeſtation of his own Glory, and formed for the good of Mankind in this World, and for conducting them to the Eternal Felicity of the World to come. And was it not defaced by the vicious practices of falſe Chriſtians, it would either convince or convert the World to it; and vindicate it ſelf from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches under which it lies with many at this day; moſt Men looking more at the Actions of Men, than the Rules of the Religion they profeſs, to judge it by; though ſome look upon it as ſome vindication of the Name of Chriſt againſt the Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in the great ſucceſs of the Chriſtians, ſo called, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> yet we may fear, that the unjuſt Practices, groſs Idolatries, inhumane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and ſcandalous Lives of many called Chriſtians, may keep them from embracing Chriſtianity. But becauſe my deſign is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, I ſhall not make it my buſineſs now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider any one Party or Denomination of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians diſtinct from another, but ſhall briefly treat of Chriſtianity it ſelf, in the Principles, Rules, Myſteries, and Deſigns of it; that all may here as in a Glaſs ſee their own face; and as moſt, I fear, may have cauſe to bluſh, ſo it may tend to reduce the Chriſtian world to a better Temper, eſpecially our own <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I find all Parties ready to reflect one upon another, whereas all may be guilty: And whilſt each are contending for ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Opinions and Circumſtances in Religion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152189:7"/> they may evidently tranſgreſs the Rules of common Chriſtianity: And while ſome are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Papiſts,</hi> others <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſome Lutherans, ſome Calveniſts, ſome <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> others <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> all are apt to forget they are called Chriſtians: And while we are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that which is Primitive in Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in the Externals of Religion, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not that which is primitive in the right Temperament of our Hearts and Lives, which if we could arrive at, or did ſtudiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, it might prevent the miſchiefs, which have befallen us, for time to come; and allay our late contentions in Religion, more than all the wrangling diſputes which have been among us; and though in doubtful things it is commendable to ſearch out Truth, and plead for it, yet not with minds poſſeſt with Paſſion, or Prejudice, which blind the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and break the bonds of Unity, Love and Peace: As the two Men mentioned by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm,</hi> who diſputing and then falling to blows in the Morning, about the place where the Sun would riſe, beat out one anothers Eyes, and ſo neither of them could ſee it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Neither</hi> is he a <hi>Soliſidian,</hi> hoping to be ſaved meerly by Believing, or naked Aſſent, but is one Zealous of good Works, as being profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152189:10"/> to Men, acceptable to God, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Religion, and neceſſary to Salvation. Yet he knows they muſt ſpring from Faith, and are not ſufficient of themſelves to his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the ſight of God; and therefore he puts not his truſt in them, but in the Mercy of God and perfect Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf at laſt thought the ſafeſt way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further,</hi> He being ſenſible of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, depends upon God for that daily ſupply of his Grace whereby he may have his Heart in a readineſs for every good work, and may ſhew forth his Faith, by his love to God and Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one who makes all his approaches to God by the one Mediator, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, without making uſe of any <hi>Sub-mediators</hi> either of Redemption or Interceſſion, not mentioned in the Goſpel; and herein he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders God, not only as a Creator, or in the abſolute perfections of his Being, but as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in the Blood of his Son, related as a Father, and ingaged by a ſpecial Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one who waits and prays for the help of Gods holy Spirit to lead him into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and to help his Infirmities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and approacheth not to him meerly by the impulſe of natural Conſcience, much leſs by the help of Pictures, or Images, forbidden by the Law of God; but by the Spirit of

                  <hi>Again,</hi> He reckons upon Suffering with Chriſt, as well as Reigning with him, of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Croſs, as well as wearing his Crown, and of Denying himſelf as becomes a Diſciple of Chriſt; and therefore Arms himſelf for it, that he may not be ſurprized by it, or faint under it; and as he will not raſhly thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon ſufferings, ſo neither decline them when neceſſarily called thereunto, wherein he will have reſpect to the goodneſs of his Call, of his Cauſe, and of his Conſcience.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one who believes a Judgment to come, and therefore lives in continual awe of it, and endeavours ſo to manage the whole courſe of his actions, that he may be accepted of the Lord in that day, and not fall under the wrath to come, and <hi>thereupon</hi> is leſs concerned about being Judged of men, or of mans day.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is careful to examin himſelf about his State towards God, and to know the inward frame and temperament of his own Soul, and the Actions of his Life in the Principle, Rule and End of them, that he may not be found among Hypocrites, and that counterfeit Grace may not be miſtaken for that which is true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His</hi> Zeal in Religion is not raſh and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, hypocritical and treacherous, violent and cruel, ſo as to tranſgreſs the Rules of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, Charity, and Sobriety; but is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Knowledge, and regulated by ſound Judgment, Wiſdom, and Diſcretion; and his greatet Zeal is about the great things of Religion, and of the greateſt certainty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one who hath a regular Conſcience, extending to one Duty as well as to another, and therefore will not <hi>ſtrain at Gnats and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Camels;</hi> nor be ſcrupulous about Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and of conforming to ſome outward

                  <hi>And</hi> if he hath a Conſcience of Conformity to the Church, he makes Conſcience of the moral Duties of Religion, and will not be found guilty of ſwearing, curſing, drunkenneſs, fornication, ſcoffing at piety, blaſphemy, falſe accuſation, or perſecution for Conſcience ſake of the truly conſcientious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>And</hi> though his practice in Religion is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his beſt Light and judgment, yet he confines not the Church of God, or mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizeth Salvation to the narrow limits of his own private Opinion, but judgeth charitably of men who Conſcientiouſly differ from him, as knowing that as in ſeveral Nations, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral Opinions, <hi>He that feareth God and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him;</hi> and therefore he can love and honour true Piety, Sincerity and Goodneſs, and real Worth, wherever he finds them; as the Phyloſophers called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Again more particularly,</hi> He is one who La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the Word and Doctrine, he readeth the Word, and maketh uſe of it in Wiſdom, for Conviction, Reproof, Inſtruction, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, or Comfort, rightly dividing the Word of Truth, as there is occaſion; and is inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> looks upon his Office as a Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and originally derived upon him from Chriſt himſelf, tho he receives the Exerciſe of it from the Deſignation of Men, or the call of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> minds the good of his Flock, and the Salvation of Souls, more than any private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his own, knowing the invaluable worth of Souls, and the Dangers they lie open to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one ſenſible of his own Inſufficiency for ſo great a Work, and therefore doth hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and daily ſeek Divine Aſiſtance from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying with the Apoſtle, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> aſcribes the Glory to God, for what
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152189:31"/> good he doth, or for what aſſiſtance, or ſucceſs he hath in his Miniſtry, as knowing that <hi>he that planteth is nothing, or he that watereth is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be ſerveth God in his Miniſtry, (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks) <hi>with all humility of Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> ſeeks not the Applauſe and Praiſe of Men, and to be called <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi;</hi> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words of our Saviour, <hi>He that is from beneath, ſeeketh his own honour:</hi> And therefore his Preaching is not in wiſdom of words, and oſtentation of Learning, or to gain a popular Auditory, but ſtrives to commend himſelf to every mans Conſcience in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> ſeeks to bring Men over to the true Knowledge of God, to the Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of true Piety according to the Goſpel, rather than to a Party or diſputable Opinion, to uphold and promote a private Intereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> affects not the ſecular Pomp, and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of this World, conſidering whoſe Servant he is, the great deſign of the Goſpel he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the Example of Chriſt his great Lord and Maſter, and of the Apoſtles ſent forth by him; much leſs doth he affect to introduce it into the New-Teſtament Church, which was well caution'd againſt in the firſt <hi>Ephiſine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; <hi>Ne ſub ſpecie adminiſtrationis rerum Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, potentiae ſecularis, Typhus in Eccleſiam ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repat, &amp;c.</hi> Canone ultimo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> ſeeks not ſo much to pleaſe as to profit
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152189:32"/> the People committed to him, and yet will become all things to all Men to gain them, and do them good; and as it is <note place="margin">

                  </gap>, a ſelf-pleaſer, ſo he is a Pleaſer of Men only to their Edification and Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one not given to Contention, nor ſoon angry, no Striker or Railer, no Promoter of Strife, Faction, or Sedition, or inhumane Cruelties, but with meekneſs inſtructeth thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if peradventure God will give them Repentance to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is not for the promoting of Religion, by Fire and Sword, as <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met;</hi> nor as ſome rigid Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is Sober, and Temperate in all things, not given to Wine, no haunter of Taverns, but uſeth all moderation in Meats and Drinks, that his Mind may be more ſedate, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to intend and diſcharge the Work he is called unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is not Moroſe, nor Stoical, but Affable, and courteous to all, and ſeeks to preſerve an Eſteem for his Perſon, to the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Miniſtry; yet he ſtudiouſly avoids all lightneſs or vanity in Speech or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152189:32"/> and by Gravity of Carriage puts an Awe, Reſpect and Reverence to his Perſon, upon the Hearts of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one not greedy of filthy Lucre, uſeth not a Cloak of Covetouſneſs, whatever Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he weareth; will not make merchandize of the People, for his private advantage; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangles not himſelf in the Affairs of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life, but is ready to deny himſelf in his Earthly Intereſts, rather than bring a blemiſh upon his Office, and obſtruct the ſucceſs of his Labours, whereby his People may ſee he ſeeketh not <hi>Theirs</hi> but <hi>Them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> He doth not Lord it over the Faith, and Conſciences of the People, but ſeeks by ſound Doctrine, and Evidence of the Truth, to convince mens Judgments, and perſwade mens Minds, to the Faith, Obedience, and love of the Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither</hi> doth he affect Preeminence, and Dominion over his Brethren, and to aſſume a Juriſdiction which Chriſt never gave him: As when in the degenerate State of the Church, the Biſhops contended about the Superiority of their <hi>Sees,</hi> and which our Saviour reproved in the Diſciples, when they diſputed who ſhould be greateſt. But what Authority he hath given to his Miniſters, he doth faithfully exerciſe it to preſerve the Churches Purity, to Propagate and Exalt his Name and Kingdom, but not to exalt himſelf: For the Jewiſh Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood being now changed, as being typical, he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152189:33"/> knows we can't argue from thence for an Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy under the Goſpel to be parallel to it, without a new Inſtitution from Jeſus Chriſt. Whereby Primacy over the Goſpel Church might be as clearly declared, as that of the High-Prieſts over the Jewiſh Church? And therefore it is well known, that the Council o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Carthage</hi> would not allow the Name of <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus Epiſcoporum,</hi> the Juriſdiction of one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop over another: yet in all difficult Caſes, he taketh advice, and ſubmitteth his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Judgment of Synods, regularly aſſembled to determine Controverſies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one who Practiſeth himſelf what he preacheth to others, Exemplifies his Doctrine in his Converſation, that he may be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to his Flock, and of good Report with thoſe that are without; and doth not tempt his People to think that he preacheth thoſe things which he himſelf believes not to be true by his not walking accordingly: And thereby not only bring Contempt on the Miniſtry; but while he preacheth to others, himſelf may be caſt away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further,</hi> He indulgeth not himſelf in Sloth and Idleneſs, follows cloſe his private Studies as ſtrength and opportunity give him leave, that he may grow in Learning, and Knowledge and be better furniſh'd for his publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; more able to convince gainſayers, and open the Myſteries of God's Kingdom, as a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152189:33"/> Miniſter of the New Teſtament, and lead up the People to further degrees of Knowledge, and higher attainments in Chriſtianity: But as for Politicks, and Myſteries of State, and the Affairs of Civil Government, he leaves them to the Study of Princes, and the Civil Magiſtrates, to whoſe Province they eſpecially belong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> He conſidering that he is for Salt to Seaſon others, he ſeeketh to maintain a favour upon his own Heart of the Doctrine that he preacheth to them, that he may not himſelf be rejected as unſavoury Salt. And for that end he is much in Prayer, for the daily ſupply of the Holy Spirit, and his teachings upon his Heart; the New-Teſtament Miniſtry being a Miniſtration of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one who feareth not the Face of Men in the diſcharge of his Duty, will not baulk or decline any Truth, or faithful Reproof of Sin, for the Fear of Man, but declares the whole Counſel of God, that he may give up his Account with Joy, and be free from the blood of all Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> will not accumulate Livings, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Cure beyond his Capacity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, leaſt he be injurious to ſome of his Brethren, who may want both Work and Maintenance, and aggravate his own Account by the neglect of his Duty. Neither doth he think it reaſonable that he ſhould live of the Flock he doth not feed, or of the Altar at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152189:34"/> which he doth not ſerve, eſpecially when no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity compells thereunto: He well knowing that at firſt there was no Biſhops, but to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Congregations, which he might be able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect with the aſſiſtance of Presbyters, where the Church was numerous; and the enlarging them to more, crept in gradually, by the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men, or humane Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one who Ruleth well his own Houſe, having his Children and Servants, in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with all Gravity; inſtructing his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the Knowledge of God, their Duty to him, and the Duty of their ſeveral Places and Relations: And if he be unmarried, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth his Mind and Body chaſt, but confines not himſelf to a ſingle life, as neceſſary to his Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> alſo Preacheth ſound Doctrine, feedeth the Souls of his People with wholſome Food, giveth not Chaff inſtead of Wheat, nor Stones inſtead of Bread, nor Scorpions inſtead of Fiſh, warneth them againſt Contentious Schiſms, the Errors, and Hereſies of the Times, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to preſerve truth uncorrupted, and his People ſound in the Faith, and to lead them the right way to Salvation, whereby he neither ſeeks to polliſh the ſimplicity of the Goſpel with vain Philoſophy, or Platonick Speculations, or corrupt its Purity by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Pelagian, Socinian,</hi> or any Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines diſſonant from the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further,</hi> He bindeth and loſeth, retains and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152189:34"/> remits Mens ſins: Yet only Miniſterially, he well knowing, that none can forgive ſins but God only, and this he doth not only by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Doctrine in his Preaching the Goſpel, but by what particular Evidence he finds of true Faith, and Repentance in Men. As the Prieſt cleanſed the Leper, when upon Examination he declared him clean, and not othewiſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And,</hi> though few queſtion but a Form of Prayer, animated with a right Intention, and holy Affection, may be accepted of God, yet he confines not himſelf to it, as knowing there may be many Emergent Caſes among his People, fit to be commended to God in Prayer, which cannot particularly be comprehended in any ſtated Form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> he hath a ſpecial Reverence for the Lords Prayer, as briefly comprizing all thoſe Bleſſings both Spiritual and Temporal which we have need to ask of God, and as Dictated by the ſacred Lips of Chriſt himſelf, but he doth not think that the meer ſaying of it doth ſanctifie his Prayer, or that it is the <hi>Sal &amp; Condimentum Sacrificii:</hi> As <hi>Durandus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale,</hi> Lib. 5. in his Diſcourſe of the Maſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is one who Preacheth and Practiſeth Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Civil Magiſtrates, making publick Prayers for Kings, and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as knowing that they are Ordinances of God, appointed for the good of Men, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the publick Peace, and the Eſtates, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152189:35"/> and Lives of the People; to be a Terror to evil-doers, and a praiſe to them that do well; and he putteth his People in mind to be ſubject to them for Conſcience-ſake, <hi>Giving to Caeſar the things which are Caeſars, and to God the things which are Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> teacheth not for Doctrine, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men, nor makes void any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God by humane Traditions, and makes no more things neceſſary to Salvation, than Chriſt hath made either in Doctrine or Worſhip, whom he knows to be Lord and Head of the Church: And yet is careful to maintain Order, and Decency in the publick Aſſemblies, for the more comely diſcharge of all publick Service, and the greater Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the People; as knowing that God is <hi>A God of Order, and not of Confuſion, as in all the Churches of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> he diſſents in any thing from the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, he doth not do it out of Faction, Pride or Obſtinacy, but out of a real, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional diſſatisfaction of Mind; makes no noiſe with his diſſent, and will not judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn other good Men in their belief, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as he would not be judged and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his own; and doth not ſeparate from the Univerſal Church, by any particular diſſent in Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> He is wiſe to Sobriety, will not too boldly ſearch into the Secrets of God, but contents himſelf to know and preach only the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152189:35"/> things that are revealed, and will not be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in dark Propheſies, or dubious Problems in Religion, but modeſtly ſubmits his own Sentiments to the Tryal and Judgment of other Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> reckons the Work of his Miniſtry not only to be Laborious, but Hazardous, a ſpiritual Warfare, and therefore doth Arm himſelf with Faith, Wiſdom, Courage, and Patience to encounter the Perils that may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the faithful diſcharge of his Function. Scripture-ſtory tells him of the Sufferings of the Prophets, and Apoſtles: Eccleſiaſtical Story of <hi>Ignatius, Policarp, Cyprian,</hi> &amp;c. and our own Martyrologies of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and many other famous Biſhops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in their days, and of the fires they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through into the Light and Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us, that the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution under <hi>Maximinus</hi> the Emperor, was particularly againſt the Paſtors and Miniſters, who are above others ſet for the defence of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> He ſerveth not God of that which coſts him nothing, digeſts well in his own Mind what he delivers to others, examines it by the unerring Rule of the Scripture, cloaths his Matter with convenient words and method, that he may approve himſelf a Workman that needeth not be aſhamed, and better ſpeak to the Underſtanding, Memory, and Affections of the People.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:152189:36"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>He</hi> ſtudiouſly avoids ridiculous Geſtures, mimical Poſtures, affected Tones, disfiguring Looks, Superſtitions, and all Antick Formalities in his publick Service, but fills up his Place with that Preſence and Gravity, as becomes the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Work that he is ingaged in, and is careful to utter nothing raſhly with his mouth before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further,</hi> He wiſely conſiders the State of his Flock, and therefore ſuits his Doctrine to the Capacity and Condition of the People; he hath ſtrong meat for the Strong, and milk for Babes; and he puts a difference betwixt the Righteous and the Wicked, the Penitent and the Obſtinate, the Scrupulous and the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſcience. He will not caſt his Pearls before Swine, nor give that which is holy unto Dogs; but will give to the Children their Bread, and as a faithful Steward, will give to all their Portion of Meat in due Seaſon: And alſo, he knowing that his Office leads him not only to Teach, but Rule, he therefore will make uſe of Chriſts Diſcipline, to preſerve the Purity of his Church, both in Doctrine, Worſhip and Manners, doing it with Wiſdom, Integrity, and Impartiality; Chriſt having put the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Order and Juriſdiction, as they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, the Keys of Doctrine and Diſcipline, in the ſame hand; and in all his uſe of the Church Keys, he is careful to avoid Extreams, which Men are apt to run into, either by opening the Door where it it ſhould be ſhut,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152189:36"/> or ſhutting it where it ſhould be open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And,</hi> Though he meets not with that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and Encouragement from Men, which he expected, and may be his due, yet he is not diſcouraged, but perſiſts in the diſcharge of his Duty, and encourageth himſelf in the Reward reſerved for him in Heaven, to be fully given when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> He is no Reſpecter of Perſons, thinks not the meaneſt and pooreſt of his Flock beneath his Care, and Charge, that he may give good Account of his Miniſtry to the chief Shepherd, who takes care of his whole Flock, and regards not the Rich more than the Poor. And though the Name of Biſhop be now confined to one particular Order of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yet he looks upon himſelf as a Biſhop in his own Congregation, to take the overſight of his whole Flock, as his Name and Office do oblige him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> hath reſpect to the Intereſt of Religion, beyond his own Congregation, as he hath Call and Opportunity, he being ſet a Miniſter in the Univerſal Church, as well as particular, and a Servant of Chriſt therein; and though he be not a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, yet is truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, and hath a Catholick Reſpect to the Service and Intereſt of his great Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in every place. Yet he will not be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to intrude himſelf into anothers Work or Charge without ground and Warrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is alſo one given to Hoſpitality, ready to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:152189:37"/> relieve the Strangers, Fatherleſs and Widows, and ſuch as are in diſtreſs, according as he hath Ability and Opportunity thereunto, that he may expreſs the Vertues upon Earth, of his great Lord and Maſter in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> regards not the Speeches and Cenſures of the People, in the Faithful diſcharge of his Duty, accounts it a ſmall thing to be Judged of Mans day, but is ſatisfied in the Teſtimony of his own Conſcience, and in the Approbation he hopes to find with God, who is the Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Heart, and hath learned to go through good Report and evil Report. And tho he obſerves ſome fooliſh and ignorant Men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Calling of the Miniſtry, yet he is not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, but magnifies his Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> If he find any of his Brethren to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in Parts, Learning, Miniſterial Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and have more ſucceſs in their Labours, and are better accepted with the People, he envies them not, but rejoyces that Chriſt is Preached, Piety promoted, and Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom propagated, though by other hands more than his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> contenteth not himſelf to Preach gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Doctrine, but ſeeks by particular Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Truth to awaken Mens Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to lead Men into the Knowledge of their Hearts; and to bring into Captivity every Thought in their Hearts into the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:152189:37"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Further,</hi> Beſides his publick Miniſtry, he is ready to go from Houſe to Houſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Afflicted, to ſupport the Feeble-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſatisfie the Scrupulous, to viſit the Sick, and pray with them, and prepare them for their latter End.</p>

                  <hi>Now Reader,</hi> By theſe things, or ſuch as theſe, we have the Portraicture of a right
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152189:38"/> Chriſtian-Goſpel-Miniſter, which as it reflects Honour upon ſome, ſo Shame upon others; However, the Office of the Miniſtry is ſacred, honourable, and neceſſary, and ought not to be in Contempt on the Account of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal miſcarriages of any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> if ſome think the Papiſts lift it up too high, let not the Proteſtants caſt it down too low, as many did in the late Times, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed all Miniſtry, but what was of their own Opinion, or Humour; which our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too prone and ſubject to. And yet let the People conſider that their Miniſters are not Angels, but Men of the like Infirmities with themſelves, and not account that a Vice in them, which they will account a Vertue in other Men.</p>
               <p>Yet I think if the Chriſtian World was well furniſht with Miniſters competently qualified, as before deſcribed, they might be accepted of the People, and uſefull to their Salvation, and own one another, as true Miniſters, notwithſtanding ſome leſſer differences in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and in the Form of their Ordinations; which the common People do not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and leſs underſtand. For we may obſerve that the publick reflections that Miniſters have made upon one another, have but taught the People to deſpiſe all Miniſtry, and their coming to Church hath been to hear other Mens faults and errors reproved, and not their own. And it may be it is no way prudent to have the People gratified in ſuch an humour.</p>

               <p>MAgiſtracy is a great Ordinance of God, for the good of Mankind. He appointed it from the beginnning, and it hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Ages, though under ſeveral Forms: And there is ſcarce any People in the World ſo barbarous and blind, but have among them ſome Government. Magiſtrates, we know, are called Gods, and bear ſome ſtamp of Gods Authority; and without them the World would run into Anarchy and Confuſion, every Mans Will, Humour, Fancy, or Luſt, would be a Law to him; and as far as his Power reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would be a Law to others: Yet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy is not founded in Grace. A bad Man may be a lawful Magiſtrate, to whom Obedience is due; as well as a bad Man may be a Father or Maſter, to whom Obedience is due both from Children and Servants; yet good Magiſtrates are to be deſired, though the bad are to be obeyed in all lawful things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> Magiſtrates are either Inferior, Superior, or Supream, the King himſelf, or Governours ſent forth by him; all which are called by the name of <hi>Powers,</hi> by the Apoſtle, though their power is not all of the ſame Nature, Extent, or Degree; yet all appointed to one common end, which is the well-being of the People both in Soul and Body.

                  <hi>Again,</hi> If he be incompaſſed with viſible Strength, and all probable ſafety, both at Home and Abroad, yet he is not ſecure, remembring the Old ſaying, <hi>Summa cadunt ſubito;</hi> nor puts his truſt in any Arm of Fleſh, as knowing the uncertainty of all humane Affairs, and the unexpected Changes that do often befall the things of this World. And therefore <hi>Conradus</hi> the Emperor choſe for his Motto, <hi>Fortuna, dum blanditur, fallit; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is Falſe when ſhe Flatters;</hi> and <hi>Citò repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcit, quae dedit,</hi> was anothers; <hi>Soon takes away what ſhe gives.</hi>

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Heathen as appears in ſtory, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing their Words equal with their Lives; and as he expects Truth and <hi>Fealty</hi> from the People, in performing their Oaths, Promiſes, and Ingagements unto him; ſo he reciprocally

And as he entertains no principles to the contrary, ſo neither is he led aſide by any bad Examples; as in the caſe of <hi>John Huſs,</hi> who was put to Death by the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> tho' he engaged his Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for his ſafety, <hi>Cochlaeus,</hi> lib. 5. <hi>Hiſtor.

And in Religion he is really before God, what he ſeems to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men. He commands not his Religion, but is commanded by it, and follows not

                  <hi>Machiavils</hi> advice to the young Prince, <hi>That to ſeem Religious may be to his advantage, but to be really ſo, may be to his prejudice.</hi> And as his place is higher, and more capacious of Service than other Mens, ſo he knows his account will be greater; and though he now ſtands above them, yet then muſt ſtand level with them, and therefore, doth not only ſeek the outward welfare of the People, but the progreſs of true Religion, to the ſaving of their Souls, and ſeeks the Honour of that God that hath put Honour upon him. For this end he doth countenance, and encourage a good Miniſtry to teach the People, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects the greateſt Honour upon them who are moſt diligent and faithful. He upholdeth Univerſities, and Schools of Learning, that there may not want Men of ability to defend the Truth; and that the Church may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with an able, Orthodox Miniſtry, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the People, and ſeeks to ſuppreſs that Vice and Wickedneſs which may provoke God, and bring down his Judgments upon him and the Nation. And he being a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, knows that Chriſt is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and that by him <hi>Kings Reign, and Princes decree Judgments;</hi> He therefore <hi>Kiſſeth the Son,</hi> lays his Government at his Feet, ſubmits to his Scepter, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates his Kingdom, and upholds whatever is truly Chriſtian, againſt all which is truly Antichriſtian, either in Doctrine or Worſhip,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152189:44"/> and derogatory to his Crown. The <hi>Motto</hi> we know upon our Kings Coin in <hi>England,</hi> is, <hi>Chriſto auſpice Regno;</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Jovinian</hi> choſe for his Motto, <hi>Scopus vitae, Chriſtus;</hi> and <hi>Charles the Great, Chriſtus regnat, vincit, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat:</hi> Wherein they acknowledged the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Chriſts Dominion, and the ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency of their Government to it: And we know the Title of the <hi>French</hi> King is, <hi>Rex Chriſtianiſſimus;</hi> but how proper to him, let <hi>Europe</hi> judge.</p>
               <p>And though he intermeddle not in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſicks of the Church of Chriſt, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Miniſtry, yet he makes uſe of his Power to preſerve Civil Peace in Church and State, and to command Obedience to the known Laws, and Ordinances of Chriſt in his Church, both in Miniſters and People, by his Power and Government in matters Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and will Protect and Encourage them therein. And as the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to write a Copy of the Law of God, and Read therein all the days of their Life, ſo he Reads and Studies the Word of God, that he may ſee with his own Eyes, and that his own Devotion towards God, and that which is Profeſſed and Practiſed by the People, may be guided by that infallible Rule. And being ſenſible of the weighty Charge of his Government, he depends upon Almighty God for his daily Aſſiſtance, Guidance, and Bleſſing. So that this fear of God doth ſteer his whole

               <p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all things be done Decently and in Order,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. <hi>ult.</hi> For the Goſpel-Worſhip being to be ſet up in all Nations, no particular Rule can agree to all herein: For that is Decent in one place that is not ſo in another, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one Church that is not ſo in another, and at one time that is not at another; And the Light of Nature, which is part of Chriſts Law, and the Cuſtom of the Place, and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Wiſdom of each Church, eſpecially of their Paſtors, and Teachers, are to guide them herein: In which things nothing is to be impoſed as an Act of meer Dominion, but upon grounds of Reaſon and Judgment: And nothing that may ſavour of Pride, Pomp, and Vanity, not becoming the ſimplicity of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That all things be done to Edification;</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 26. So that whatſoever is introduced into the Worſhip of God that tends not to this, is forbidden by this General Rule; whereby all ſuch Ceremonies that are meerly Arbitrary, and ſuch Practices which hinder Edification, are to be excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> each particular Church is beſt able to judge in this Caſe, what may be beſt for their own Edification: And what is thus judged, is no longer to be accounted as a thing meerly indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. And the Apoſtle himſelf conformed to this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152189:52"/> Rule, ſaying, <hi>All things are lawful for Me, but all things edifie not.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 23. And adviſed all Churches to manage all their Church-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations to this End.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That all things be done without Offence,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 32. Which Rule reſpects things Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, and not Eſſential in Worſhip: And juſt occaſions of Offence, and not groundleſs Exceptions, and things diſputable rather than ſuch as are clear and plain, and the direct Commandments of God. About theſe things the Apoſtle requires Chriſtians to be tender in giving Offence one to another, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to walk charitably; for to offend againſt the Law of Charity, is to offend againſt one of the greateſt Laws of Chriſts Kingdom: And hereby, by giving offence, a Brother may ſtumble, fall, and periſh, for whom Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though</hi> no Offence to Man can ſuperſede our Obedience to the expreſs Command of God; yet we ought to forbear ſinning againſt a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whenever it may be done without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God: Though one Mans Liberty is not to be judged by anothers Conſcience; yet in things not neceſſary, we are to have reſpect to anothers Conſcience as well as our own.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let every Man be fully ſatisfied in his own Mind.</hi> Rom. 14. 5. Which General Rule forbids pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in Religion with a doubting Conſcience; whereby, that may be lawful to one which is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152189:52"/> not to another, and ſinful to one that is not to another: As to eat Fleſh might be ſinful to one, and not to another; and ſo keeping of days, as the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. whereby Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould be tender of forcing their own Sentiments, eſpecially in doubtful things, upon anothers Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Abſtain from all Appearance of Evil,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 22. Many things may in themſelves be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet not to be practis'd when they carry an Appearance of Evil. Religion may be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd, and real Evil encouraged, by that which is not a real Evil, but only hath an Appearance of it: As to ſit at meat in an Idols Temple, was not evil in it ſelf (for an Idol is nothing, and the Sacrifice offered is properly nothing, that is, no Sacrifice) but it had an Appearance of Evil, to him that had not that Knowledge; and therefore the Apoſtle doth forbid that practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 14. and requires them to flee from Idolatry in that Shew and Appearence of it; and ſo thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in Worſhip that are abuſed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, ſhould be laid aſide rather than others, becauſe they have an Appearance of Evil: I know what is anſwered, that they may be uſed where the Superſtition or Idolatry of them are declared againſt. But I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Primitive Chriſtians would not have put Incenſe into the Fire of the Sacrifice offered to an Idol, thô they might have had Liberty to declare againſt the Idolatry of it:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152189:53"/> Nor the three Children bow to <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>'s Image, tho they might have declared againſt the Idol. And the Apoſtle forbids eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meat in the Idols Temple, thô it was not thought that they were Idolaters who ſat there, or practiſed Idolatry. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they came into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> to ſymbolize with the Cuſtoms of the Heathen, tho in themſelves not evil, becauſe they had an Appearance of Evil; and their minds thereby might be the ſooner recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Evil it ſelf. Superſtition is very catching, and therefore the occaſions of it are dangerous; which made <hi>Hezekiah</hi> break in pieces the brazen Serpent, when abuſed to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 4.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The</hi> laſt General Rule is: <hi>Let all things be done to the Glory of God;</hi> which though it be a General Rule to all the Actions of Mens Life, yet the Apoſtle applies it to things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indifferent in Religion, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; as about eating things offered to an Idol; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. ſo that nothing ſhould be practis'd herein, but what may tend to this General End: And hereupon forbids the uſing of that Liberty that may offend anothers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and cauſe him to fall, as that which would not be to the Glory of God, <hi>v.</hi> 32. yea, whatever it is that offends againſt any of the forementioned Rules, is not for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And this General Rule well obſerved, would direct Chriſtians much in the managing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152189:53"/> ſuch Circumſtances in Religion, where there is no expreſs Rule or Inſtitution; and limit all Governours from impoſing ſuch things in Worſhip, which tend not at all to the Glory of God.</p>
               <p>And tho I know 'tis not well poſſible to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all Scruples particularly, which may be made about Chriſtian-Worſhip; yet I believe theſe General Rules well obſerved, would make Peace with all judicious, and ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And I eaſily grant, that the Goſpel Church is left more at Liberty in Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Worſhip, than the Jewiſh Church, as about Times and Places, and Poſtures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt intending a more ſpiritual Worſhip in theſe dayes, hath not tyed us up to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of every minute Circumſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, or appointed any outward Pomp and Splendor therein, as in the Temple-Worſhip of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeeking now a true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Worſhip.</p>
               <p>And as for that General Rule which ſome aſſert in this Caſe, that what Chriſt hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in his Worſhip, humane Authority may Command, and what he hath left Indifferent, may by Men be made neceſſary, I would wiſh all Proteſtants to take heed of urging it; for we know the evil uſe the Papiſts have made of it. Where, ſay they, are the uſe of Oyl, Cream, Spittle, Exorciſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> forbidden in Baptizing? where is the uſe of Holy Water, when they enter their Temples, forbidden?
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152189:54"/> where is Sprinkling the Head with Aſhes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden? where is the uſe of Pictures and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as helps to Devotion, forbidden? And where is the Croſſing themſelves, as they do upon ſeveral occaſions, forbidden? And much more of this kind is uſed by them. But we know our Saviour excuſed his Diſciples from obſerving the Traditions which the Phariſees urged upon the People, though they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Authority of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church: Such as waſhing of Hands, Cups, Platters, which ſeem to be very innocent Ceremonies: And were ſuch things as theſe only recommended, and not enjoyned, if they did no good, they might do no hurt; but when they are made neceſſary to Church Communion, and for not obſerving them, People are ſhut out of the Church, and the ordinary means of Salvation, the miſchief is unſpeakable. And let it be conſidered, when God under the Law required in Sacrifice either two Turtle Doves, or two young Pidgeons, whether any Authority in the Jewiſh Church or State might determine that which God left indifferent; but herein let the former Rules be obſerved.</p>
               <p>And I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe, with adding a few Paſſages out of the late Author of <hi>The Diſcourſe of an Infallible Judge:</hi> A Learned Divine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>There</hi> is, (ſaith he) an eaſie and effectual way of Curing Church Diviſions, without having a Judge of Controverſies, nay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152189:54"/> making all Men of a mind in every thing, which muſt never be expected in this World. And that is, not to make the neceſſary terms of Communion ſtraighter and narrower than Chriſt hath made them; nothing but what is plainly revealed in Scripture, and is Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to Chriſtian Faith and Worſhip: For ſuch matters moſt Chriſtians agree in, and tho they may have ſome private Opinions of their own, this ought not to divide Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, while they do not impoſe them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Faith of others, nor introduce any new and ſtrange Worſhip unto the Chriſtian Church. <hi>P.</hi> 55.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> 
                  <q>If Catholick Communion be the Communion of the whole Catholick Church from the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to the end of the World, which is but one Church, and the Apoſtolick Churches are the true meaſure and Standard of true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion, then thoſe Churches which are to this day in Communion with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, are in true Catholick Communion: And this Teſt we will ſtand by, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 78.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> In the ſame Page, <q>The Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of particular Churches doth not conſiſt in uſing the ſame Liturgies, or External Rites of Worſhip, if their Worſhip be a Right Chriſtian-Worſhip, and agreeable to the General Rules of the Goſpel. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church hath Authority within her ſelf
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152189:55"/> to direct, and Model her own Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> therefore thoſe that keep to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Terms of Communion, cannot juſtly be charged with Schiſm. And theſe Rules obſerved would have prevented thoſe Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have bin in the Chriſtian World, upon the account of Rites and Ceremonies, or ſome little difference in Religion. And this is all I ſhall ſpeak about Chriſtian-Worſhip in the External part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> therefore ſhall next ſpeak of it in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of it: Of which our Saviour ſpeaks. <hi>John</hi> 4. 23. <hi>The hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth:</hi> But this is General; but more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, he that worſhips as a Chriſtian,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He</hi> Worſhips in the Faith of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which is a Faith reſpecting Chriſt as already come; and not as yet to come, as the Faith of the Old Teſtament did. And he worſhips in greater aſſurance of Faith alſo; which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of as proper to the New Teſtament; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. Chriſt having now actually Suffered, and the New Covenant ſealed with his Blood, and aſcended Heaven to make Interceſſion, as our great High-Prieſt. The Faith of the New Teſtament hath more aſſurance in it, wherein the Saints do worſhip and draw nigh to God. <hi>Let us draw nigh with full aſſurance of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10. 22. <hi>Let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</hi> Heb. 4. 16.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152189:55"/> 
                  <hi>Having therefore boldneſs to enter the Holieſt,</hi> Heb. 10. 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He</hi> Worſhips, not in the Oldneſs of the Letter, but in the Newneſs of the Spirit. This oldneſs of the Letter referrs either to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, or Moral Law. The true Chriſtian worſhips not in the oldneſs of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: He worſhips not in the Ordinances of the Ceremonial Law, but only in what was ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually ſignified in them: His Incenſe is fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer aſcending to Heaven, in the Fire of the Holy Ghoſt: His Peace-offering is hearty Thankſgiving: His Heave-offering is an Heart lifted up to Heaven: His Wine-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Joy in God: His Sin-offering is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Confeſſion of Sin, and a Broken Heart: His Burnt-offering is his whole Body of Sin offered up to be deſtroyed: He keeps the Feaſt of Tabernacles by living as a Stranger upon Earth, and Travelling towards the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Countrey: He keeps the Feaſt of Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in his worſhipping and living without the Leaven of Hypocriſie and Malice in his Heart all his Days: His Waſhings and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyings, are the Sanctifyings of his Heart and Conſcience: And his looking towards the Temple in Worſhip, is his looking to Chriſt herein. And this is one part of his worſhipping God in Spirit and in Truth, and not in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p>So alſo he Worſhips not God in the outward Letter of the Moral Law; that is, meerly by the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152189:56"/> force of an outward Letter without the inward Principle of a renewed mind: when the outward Letter of the Law ſtriking upon the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, carries a Man ſorth to Worſhip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any love to the Duty, any life or delight in it, this is to worſhip in the oldneſs of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. The Letter is ſaid to kill, <hi>but the Spirit giveth life;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6.

                  <hi>So</hi> that the Right Chriſtian Worſhipper looks at God as in Chriſt, and as manifeſted in the Work of Redemption.

                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The true Chriſtian Worſhipper wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in Humility of Mind: The Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſo clearly ſhewing man, above all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, his loſt and wretched State in his Fall, and that he hath all his Righteouſneſs, Life, Strength and Hope in another, out of himſelf. It teacheth him to worſhip in Humility: As the twenty four Elders worſhip, falling upon their Faces, and caſting down their Crowns before the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 10. A Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right Goſpel-worſhip; which Chriſt therefore would have dreſt up in a decent plainneſs, that it might be performed in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and not in Oſtentation.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what is the Internal part of Right Chriſtian-Worſhip: Not that it doth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152189:57"/> not require alſo the humble Geſtures and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the outward Man, which was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Old Teſtament, and ought to be alſo in the New, and was practiſed by Chriſt himſelf; and the Light of Nature did lead the Heathens to it in their Worſhip: And the Chriſtian Religion excludes none of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Light of Nature. But that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is more ſtrictly Chriſtian, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Spirit, from an Evangelical Principle, and according to the Laws and Inſtitutions of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither</hi> doth this Religion exclude publick Oratories, Temples, or as we call them, <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> for publick Worſhip, or any convenient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appropriate thereunto. The Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the forementioned Rules of doing all things Decently and to Edification, in the worſhip of God, doth direct to them; but to think that the Place makes the worſhip acceptable, is no Chriſtian Principle, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no holineſs in it, like the Jewiſh Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and under no ſuch Inſtitution. For that Temple was figurative both of Chriſt and the Goſpel-Church: So that God hath his Temple ſtill, his Viſible Church, as the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Corinthians, Whoſe Temple you are:</hi> And as that Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> had its outward and inward Court, ſo it is now: Some who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the outward Form only, which are the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152189:58"/> outward Court given up to the Gentiles or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizing Chriſtians, and are that Temple where the Man of Sin ſits, and which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not, and will not have it meaſured: And others who worſhip God in Spirit, and are the inward Court, and the true Temple and Altar, meaſured by the line of Gods Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and where Chriſt doth ſit and walk. And was this Spiritual Worſhip more regarded, I believe we ſhould not contend ſo much about the Ceremonial part; which when it is forced upon Men by Fines and Penalties, it looks more like Antichriſtian than Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

                  <hi>Again,</hi> He looks upon his Employment not only as Lawful but Honourable, the Honour of moſt Noble Families being raiſed firſt in the Field; and therefore ſeeks to put on that true greatneſs of Mind, whereby on a right principle, he can look upon Dangers and Difficulties ſo below him, as that he is able to Encounter them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further,</hi> He hath a general Satisfaction, at leaſt, of the juſtneſs of his Cauſe. Tho' he knows not the ſecret Councels and Reaſons of State, or of every particular Command, which may not be fit for him to know; yet he believes in general, that the War he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth in, is not upon any wicked deſign, meerly to ſatisſie the Ambition or Revenge of Men, but for the defence of Liberty, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152189:65"/> or true Religion, againſt ſuch who do invade them. For what is not of Faith is ſin, is a <hi>General</hi> Rule in the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> will not make uſe of his Sword for any unjuſt Violence, either to Mens Perſons, Goods or Eſtates, or to uſurp that which is not his own, becauſe he hath power in his hand, but is Content with his Wages, and makes no Mutiny: And the Power of his Sword is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſtraint of his Conſcience, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> will be faithful to his Cauſe, and his Prince, that intruſts him with the Sword; And abhorrs to be treacherous and perfidious, as that which is below a Man, much more a Chriſtian. For as the Heathen did deteſt it, ſo they honoured Fidelity even in an Enemy: And if in any thing he is diſſatisfied, he will rather lay down his Arms, than uſe them in Hypocriſie, and Treachery to the Power that doth both pay and truſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> counts not his Life dear that he may ſerve his Countrey, the Welfare of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Publick good: He knowing that he was not born for himſelf, and that his Strength, his Spirits, his Skill and Life are well improved when they are Sacrificed to the good of Mankind, eſpecially in any
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152189:66"/> Chriſtian Service, either at Home or Abroad. And that he may pay a Tribute to God, the King, and his Countrey, when he pays his Tribute to Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> ſeeing that Courage is neceſſary to his Warfare, and that it is the gift of God; he looks up to Heaven for it, that he may not turn back in the day of Battle, and by baſe Cowardiſe betray his Cauſe, open the way to a deſtroying Enemy, and expoſe or diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage himſelf: Having in his Thoughts the Speech of <hi>Joab</hi> in the Head of his Army, <hi>Be of Good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and the Cities of our God, and the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good,</hi> 2 Sam. 10. 12. True Chriſtian Courage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> knows he carries his Life in his hand, when he goes forth to War, and therefore doth intruſt it in the hand of that God who gave it him, and hath appointed its Bounds; And he knows that God can as well preſerve it abroad as at home, in the Field as in the Chamber; and being in his way, he may hope for Gods Keeping and Protection over him in his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, as well as in any other Employment: And if an eaſie Death be deſireable, thoſe that are Slain in the Field have commonly the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thoſe that die in their Beds.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>He</hi> truſts not in his own Strength, Skill or Courage, or in the Numbers of Horſe or Men; but he knows, as a Chriſtian, that Victory is in the hand of God: And therefore after the beſt improvement of Martial Skill, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all advantages that are before him, he makes the Lord his only truſt, and commits all Succeſſes into his hand, as becomes a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is content in the Station wherein he is ſet; whether in higher or lower Command, or under Command; and is careful to be found in his proper Duty, and diſcharge of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the place he ſtands in; whether of Commanding, or Commanded; that there may be no breach upon Military Order, or through the Irregularity of any one Wheel, the motion of the whole may be diſcompoſed, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced: And to be content and diligent in our own Place and Station, is, we know, a Rule enjoyned in Chriſtanity; and if he deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an higher Station, he ſeeks to raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it, by his Courage and Faithfulneſs in the place where at preſent he ſtands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> is willing to deny himſelf in his outward Accommodations, and to endure hardſhip in the attending his preſent Warfare; and eſpecially when the Cauſe of Liberty and Religion is in Jeopardy: In which Caſe he ſaith with that brave Man <hi>

When the publick <hi>All</hi> ſeems to lye at Stake, he expoſeth his Fleſh to hardſhip, as well as his Life to hazards; and ſhakes off an Effeminate Temper of Mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> alſo carefully avoids thoſe Sins and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties which uſually attend the Camp; as Drunkenneſs, Rapes, Swearing, Curſing, Quarrelling, horrid Imprecations, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all ſuch Debauchery, which is diſhonourable to humane Nature as well as Chriſtianity. And as God required the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> when they went forth to War, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all Ceremonial Uncleanneſs out of the Camp, that he might not forſake it; ſo the Chriſtian Souldier will avoid thoſe moral pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which may be diſpleaſing and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Eyes of that God from whom he knows comes all Succeſs and Victory; and for the cauſe of which, great Armies have been often defeated, and rebuk'd from Heaven; as Chriſtians well know.</p>
               <p>And if he meet with Succeſs, and his Arms Proſper, he gives not the Glory of it to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Strength, or Skill of Men, but, as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, he gives all Glory to God himſelf, well
